# Python-Programs
A collection of a few of my Python Programs.
The EBAY program uses the Python sdk libraries to scrape ebay listings from the users search, all with a GUI created with Python's TKinter library.
The ProductComparo program uses TKinter to allow for a graphical user interface for a product and its details. This then returns the best product for each category, depending on the price, shipping cost, etc,  and can be custom saved as a file to your desktop.
The Tkinter Gmail Program uses the smtplib and MIME libraries to link to the Gmail server, and use the users account credentials for login. The user can then add a a subject, message, and optional attachment, and send it to any Gmail user.
