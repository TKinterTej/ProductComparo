# Python-Programs
A collection of a few of my Python Programs.
The EBAY program uses the Python sdk libraries to scrape ebay listings from the users search, all with a GUI created with Python's TKinter library.
The ProductComparo program uses TKinter to allow for a graphical user interface for a product and its details. This then returns the best product for each category, depending on the price, shipping cost, etc,  and can be custom saved as a file to your desktop.
