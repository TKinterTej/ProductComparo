# Python-Programs
A collection of a few of my Python Programs.
The EBAY program uses the sdk libraries to scrape ebay listings from the users search, all with a GUI
The ProductComparo program uses TK to allow for user entry for a product and its details, and returns the best prosuct for each category, and can be custom saved to your desktop.
